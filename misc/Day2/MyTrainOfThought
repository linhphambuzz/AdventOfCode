First attempt to solve the problem in Python: 
1. Transverse through each line using while loop 
2. Append character in each line into an array 
3. Now, transverse through this newly created array to obtain number of minimum and maximum that the given letter is allowed to appear
4.while transvering through this array, I also want to know at what index the passwords starts to show 
5.Create another array to store just the password 
6.Transverse through this second array and count how many times the given letter appear 
7.If the times that the given letter shows up is in the allowance range, then increase the count of the right password by 1. 
The reason I choose Python for this problem is because of the incomplexity of the readline and readfile that python has.
